    "This LRT, according to Wilks' theorem, follows a $\\chi^2$ distribution with one degree of freedom ($\\chi_1^2$). As the square of a normal variable is also distributed as a $\\chi_1^2$, it is easy to \"translate\" the probability corresponding to the output of the LRT, to units of sigma (i.e. of std. deviations of a normal distribution). In particular, one just needs to take the square root of Eq. 1.5.\n",

It is the formula adopted in VHE astrophysics to claim the significance of a signal. The statistics at Eq. (1.4) is handled by `Gammapy`'s [`WStatCountsStatistics`](https://docs.gammapy.org/dev/api/gammapy.stats.WStatCountsStatistic.html#gammapy.stats.WStatCountsStatistic)."

    "Another common method to visualise the presence of a signal, and to compute its statistical significance, is to build a $\\theta^2$ histogram. Instead of simply counting the events in the _on_ and _off_ regions, we make a histogram of their squared angular distances from the region centres: source position for _on_, and the region-centres for _off_. To determine the quantities $N_{\\rm on}$ and $N_{\\rm off}$, we count all the bin values within a cut in $\\theta^2$ that is basically the size of the _on_ region squared. With this method one can nicely visualise the presence of the signal in the _on_ region, as the counts steadily increase as we approach the zero, that is the centre of the _on_ region that in turn corresponds to the source position.\n",
